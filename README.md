# Just some mimicdb

first implementation is very basic of TLV encodig decoding 

To run this mmm 

* I dont think there are any requirements other than some python env 
* U can create ur custom table and run select operation (insert and select are the only ones updated as of now ) just go thru test.py and test.ipynb u might get the idea 

*Code isnt structured yet i just kept almost all class in modals but u can go thru it
